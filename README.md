function calculateLoan() {

This line declares a JavaScript function named calculateLoan. Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code that can be executed when they are called.
loanAmountValue = document.getElementById("loan-amount").value;

This line retrieves the value entered into an input field with the ID "loan-amount" and assigns it to the variable loanAmountValue. The getElementById method of the document object is used to select the HTML element, and .value is used to get the value entered into the input field.
interestRateValue = document.getElementById("interest-rate").value;

Similar to the previous line, this retrieves the value entered into an input field with the ID "interest-rate" and assigns it to the variable interestRateValue.
MonthsToPayValue = document.getElementById("months-to-pay").value;

This line retrieves the value entered into an input field with the ID "months-to-pay" and assigns it to the variable MonthsToPayValue.
interest = (loanAmountValue * (interestRateValue * 0.01)) / MonthsToPayValue;

This line calculates the interest amount based on the loan amount, interest rate, and number of months to pay. It multiplies the loanAmountValue by the interest rate converted to a decimal (by dividing by 100), and then divides by the number of months to pay.
monthlyPayment = (loanAmountValue / MonthsToPayValue + interest).toFixed(2);

This line calculates the monthly payment by adding the interest to the loan amount divided by the number of months to pay. The toFixed(2) method is used to round the result to two decimal places.
document.getElementById("payment").innerHTML = Monthly Payment: ${monthlyPayment};

This line updates the content of an HTML element with the ID "payment" to display the calculated monthly payment. It uses string interpolation to include the value of the monthlyPayment variable.
}

This line ends the calculateLoan function.
Overall, this code calculates the monthly payment for a loan based on the loan amount, interest rate, and number of months to pay, and then displays the result on the webpage.
